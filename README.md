# Sudoku Solver Using AI

This project utilizes OpenCV and Keras followed by a backtracking algorithm to solve various Sudoku puzzles.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ayushma99/Suduko_Solver_Using_AI.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Suduko_Solver_Using_AI
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run Jupyter Notebook to explore the project:
   ```
   notebooks\final.ipynb
   ```

## How It Works
To understand how the Sudoku solver works, check out the following files in notebooks folder:
- **main.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the solver and how it works.
- **modelmaking.ipynb**: Here, you can find the process of training the model used for Sudoku solving.

## Dataset Creation
I have created custom datasets from the given suduko images to train the numbers. This datasets are saved in `images` folder Explore the dataset creation process in the `notebooks/main.ipynb` file.

## Results
